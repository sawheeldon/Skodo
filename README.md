Latest Football news and highlights.

This tiny app pivoted halfway through due to the lack of free APIs for football results, stats, leagues and live scores into a news service app. 

It is password protected, and currently focuses on global, italian and english football news. 

You can also search for highlights of your team. The App is a re-factor of an older project of mine, to showcase my knowledge of:

Node, Express, Passport, Chai, bcrypt, Javascript, Ajax, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and MongoDB.

The App utilises 3 live news APIs in multiple ways and uses a youtube API for video highlights.

Hope you enjoy it!

Please review my screenshots folder to see the App up close and personal.
